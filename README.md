# haunted-redux
redux hooks for [haunted](https://github.com/matthewp/haunted) same as [react-redux](https://github.com/reduxjs/react-redux) hooks.

## <a name="goals">Goals</a>
- provide similar to react-redux hooks API for haunted users

## Note source code deviation
If you read the source code you will notice that it is 99% a copy of `react-redux`. There was [an attempt](https://github.com/reduxjs/react-redux/issues/1384) in trying to avoid that.
I am open for change any time, [Hence goals of this project](#goals)
